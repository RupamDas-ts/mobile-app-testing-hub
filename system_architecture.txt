System Architecture:

1. App Management Service (AppService)
---------------------------------------
- Handles app uploads and stores them under a unique app ID.
- Exposes an endpoint to accept app uploads and store them.
- Provides an optional endpoint to retrieve app details.

Endpoints:
  - POST /upload: Receives an app (file upload) and returns the app ID.
  - GET /apps/{appId}: Retrieve app details (app name, version, etc.).

2. Simulator Management Service (SimulatorService)
---------------------------------------------------
- Manages iOS simulators and app installation on simulators.
- Accepts a request to create and configure simulators, installs apps, and manages Appium server instances.

Endpoints:
  - POST /simulate: Boot a simulator and install the app. Receives device name, platform version, and app ID.
  - POST /simulators/start: Starts a simulator with a required configuration (device name, platform version).
  - POST /appium/start: Starts an Appium server and initializes the automation session.

3. Appium Proxy Service (ProxyService)
--------------------------------------
- Acts as a proxy between the Appium client and the Appium server.
- Intercepts session creation requests and WebDriver commands from the client, modifies them, and forwards them to Appium.

Endpoints:
  - POST /wd/hub: Main entry point for session creation requests. Accepts capabilities, including app ID and other configurations.
  - /wd/hub/session/:sessionId/...
    - Intercepts and forwards WebDriver commands to the Appium server.

Workflow:
1. App Upload:
   - User uploads a mobile app to AppService using POST /upload.
   - AppService stores the app and returns an app ID.

2. Simulator Management and App Installation:
   - User sends a request to SimulatorService via POST /simulate with device name, platform version, and app ID.
   - SimulatorService boots the correct iOS simulator, installs the app, and starts Appium server.

3. Appium Automation:
   - User sends WebDriver commands to ProxyService via POST /wd/hub/session with the app ID, device configuration, etc.
   - ProxyService forwards these commands to the appropriate Appium server for test execution.

Tech Stack:
- Node.js (JavaScript) for backend API services.
- Appium for mobile automation on simulators.
- Xcode/iOS Simulators for device management.
- Docker for containerization.
- Kubernetes for service orchestration.
- Redis/MongoDB (optional) for tracking sessions and app metadata.

Expected Endpoints and Functions:

1. AppService:
   - POST /upload: Upload an app and return app ID.
   - GET /apps/{appId}: Retrieve app details (optional).

2. SimulatorService:
   - POST /simulate: Boot simulator and install app.
   - POST /simulators/start: Start simulator.
   - POST /appium/start: Start Appium server.

3. ProxyService:
   - POST /wd/hub: Handle session creation and WebDriver commands.
